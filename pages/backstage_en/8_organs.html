The two medieval pieces, <i>Adesto Sancta Trinita</i> by Philippe de Vitry and <i>Ave Regina Caelorum</i> by Walter Frye, are performed by Christophe d’Alessandro on a replica of the gothic organ from the Anaya Chapel in Salamanca. This historical instrument, originally built around the early 15th century (circa 1430), was reconstructed between 2015 and 2020 under the initiative of Éric Brottier by organ builder Frédéric Desmottes (Landete, Cuenca). Christophe d’Alessandro is the principal organist at the Sainte Élisabeth church, Paris, and a research director at the CNRS.

The reconstruction is based on in-depth organological studies and detailed technical surveys of the surviving materials. This unique replica of a gothic tribune organ features a single manual with 38 keys (from F1 to A5, excluding G#5), 33 façade pipes, and approximately 200 pipes in total. It provides a historically faithful means of performing 14th- and early 15th-century repertoire.

For the motet <i>Adesto Sancta Trinita</i> by Philippe de Vitry, the full stops of the organ are employed. Philippe de Vitry, a key composer of the 14th century, served as a canon at Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris.
For <i>Ave Regina Caelorum</i>, only the first stop of the organ is used. It is worth noting that English music — possibly by Frye — was performed at Notre-Dame during the coronation of Henry V of England as King of France on December 16, 1431.

<i>Fantasia</i> by Charles Racquet is performed by Olivier Latry on the organ of the amphitheater at the Cité de la Musique, Philharmonie de Paris. Built in 1995 by Jean-François Dupont (Ifs, Calvados), this instrument features two manuals, a pedalboard, and 29 stops. Designed primarily for 17th- and 18th-century German repertoire, it is particularly well-suited to the music of Charles Racquet, who served as the organist at Notre-Dame in the early 17th century. Olivier Latry is a titular organist at the Notre Dame de Paris Cathedral.

<i>Carillon de Westminster</i> by Louis Vierne is played by Olivier Latry on the Grand Organ of Saint-Sulpice in Paris. This symphonic organ, a masterpiece by Aristide Cavaillé-Coll built in 1862, has remained in its original condition. Its exceptional sound quality closely resembles the sonic environment familiar to Louis Vierne, the iconic organist of Notre-Dame.
