<h2>Unusual sound recording techniques</h2>

<p>
Designing the recording of such a project requires a different approach compared to stereophonic sound recording. In two-channel stereophony, a microphone pair is traditionally used, capturing a sort of "spatial photograph" of the musical formation in its acoustic environment. Based on this foundation, additional microphones are placed close to specific instruments or groups of instruments within the ensemble to enhance their clarity in the sound image produced by the main microphone pair. The pair is the furthest device from the sound sources: the distance between the pair and the source is adjusted to achieve the desired balance between direct and reverberated sound. The further the pair is from the sources, the more it emphasizes the room's acoustics. Each additional microphone is individually placed closer to its source to achieve the best compromise between sound quality and the crosstalk caused by nearby sources.
</p>

<p>
In our case, to achieve the best results during the convolution process, it is essential that the treated sound sources are free from any pre-existing acoustics. These sources are therefore recorded without using a pair, relying solely on close microphones, ideally in an anechoic chamber, to eliminate any reflections or reverberation inherent to the recording space. This approach allows each source to be processed individually in RoomZ.
</p>


<h2>Recording the 11 Works</h2>

<p>
Eleven pieces closely tied to the musical history of Notre-Dame were selected for the virtual concert, ranging from 12th-13th century organum to works from the 20th-century "revival" of the French organ school.
</p>


<h3>01-02: Organum Iudea et Ierusalem, Léonin et Viderunt Omnes, Pérotin</h3>

<p>
Recording carried out on October 10, 2023, in the anechoic chamber of Jussieu with the ensemble Pérotin le Grand: 7 singers, including 1 soloist, 2 tenors, and 7 singers for the plainchant.
</p>

<p>
This anechoic chamber is an experimental space with absorbing surfaces (covered with acoustic absorbing wedges one metre deep, vibrationally decoupled from the building) designed to minimize acoustic reflections. The anechoic chamber at the Institut Jean Le Rond d'Alembert has a usable volume of 240 m³ and a floor area of 42 m².
</p>

<p>
Each of the seven voices in the organum constitutes a distinct sound source: thus, seven microphones were used. After testing between DPA 4088 cardioid microphones and B&K/DPA 4007 omnidirectional microphones, the DPA 4088 was chosen. These microphones, mounted on headsets and attached to the singers, maintain a constant distance between the microphone and the singer's mouth regardless of their movements. Unlike DPA 4007 microphones mounted on stands, this ensures consistent sound quality for each voice.

Each of the seven voices in the organum constitutes a distinct sound source to capture, requiring seven microphones. After tests conducted between cardioid DPA 4088 microphones and omnidirectional B&K 4007 microphones, the DPA 4088 were chosen. These microphones, mounted on headsets and fixed to the singers, maintain a constant distance between the microphone and the singer’s mouth regardless of their movements, unlike the B&K 4007 placed on stands. This setup ensures a consistent sound rendering for each voice. The cardioid directionality of the microphones, combined with their close proximity to the source, helps to isolate each voice from neighboring sound sources. The singers are spaced 1.2 meters apart and arranged in a semi-circle.

<h3>03-04: Adesto, Philippe de Vitry et Ave regina, Walter Frye</h3>

<p>
Recording carried out on December 19, 2023, in Bussy on Éric Brottier's organ, performed by Christophe d’Alessandro.
</p>

<p>
This recording was made in Éric Brottier’s auditorium in Bouzy, Champagne. The instrument is a replica of a Salamander organ from Spain. It was chosen by Christophe d’Alessandro for the performance of these two pieces. It is meant to represent the first swallow’s nest organ and the first tribune organ of Notre-Dame. The sound of an organ results from various acoustic phenomena. Initially produced by the vibration of multiple pipes, the sound resonates within the organ case before being projected through the façade of the instrument. This replica consists of about one hundred pipes, each acting as a distinct sound source. These pipes are spatially separated but grouped in a case divided into five compartments.
</p>

<img class="img-responsive borderless" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/re_12.jpg">

<p>
A microphone array consisting of DPA 4011c cardioid microphones (microphones 6 to 10) is positioned on a stand in front of the organ’s façade. This array, processed in post-production with the auralization engine, allows for a realistic rendering of the instrument's apparent width and its sound radiation. This setup also helps reproduce the various depth planes of all the pipes across the compartments of the organ case (close and distant planes).
</p>

<p>
The organ case is divided into five shallow compartments, each containing five microphones for comprehensive coverage of the compartments. These Schoeps CMC-1 L microphones, equipped with Mk4 cardioid capsules (microphones 1 to 5), will be used to balance the instrument in post-production.

<h3>05-06-08: Ave Maria gratia Dei plena, Antoine Brumel et Kyrie de la Messe Vidi specosam, Matthieu Sohier et Credo de la Missa Eripe me Domine, Henri Frémart</h3>

<p>
Recording carried out on January 12, 2024, on the Jeanne A. de Tarrazi Stage 2 at the Conservatoire de Paris, in collaboration with the <a href="https://cmbv.fr/">Centre de Musique Baroque de Versailles</a> (CMBV).
</p>

<p>
The Jeanne A. de Tarrazi stage was divided into two sections using very thick velvet curtains to reduce the space’s volume, which was too large for this ensemble and overly reverberant for the project. Reflective walls were treated with Texaa acoustic treatment panels, and rugs were placed on the floor to limit reflections. For Frémart’s piece, the highly resonant organ was surrounded by absorbent panels to reduce crosstalk on the singers' microphones.
</p>

<img class="img-responsive borderless" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/re_14.jpg">

<p>
Each of the ten voices of the cantors and six voices of the choristers constitutes a distinct sound source to capture, requiring the use of 16 microphones. DPA 4088 cardioid microphones were selected for this purpose. Mounted on headsets and secured to the singers, these microphones maintain a constant distance between the microphone and the singer’s mouth, regardless of movement. This ensures a consistent sound rendering for each voice. The cardioid directionality of the microphones, combined with their close proximity to the source, isolates each voice from neighboring sources. The singers are spaced 1.2 meters apart and arranged in a semi-circle for Brumel and in two semi-circles for Sohier and Frémart.
</p>

<img class="img-responsive borderless" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/re_13.jpg">

<p>
In Frémart’s work, a continuo featuring a positive organ and a viola da gamba is included. The organ is equipped with a microphone array of three Neumann KM 184 cardioid microphones, while the viola da gamba is captured using two Schoeps Mk4V cardioid microphones.

<h3>07: Fantaisie, Charles Racquet</h3>

<p>
Recorded on September 19, 2023, in the Amphitheater of the Philharmonie de Paris, on the Dupont organ, interpreted by Olivier Latry.
</p>

<p>
This recording was made in the Amphitheater of the Philharmonie de Paris on September 19, 2023, using the Jean-François Dupont organ from 1995. This modern instrument is recommended for performing 17th and 18th-century music. Olivier Latry chose it for the interpretation of Charles Racquet's Fantasia.
</p>

<img class="img-responsive borderless" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/re_3.jpg">

<p>
The organ consists of hundreds of pipes, each acting as a distinct sound source. These pipes are grouped into a case divided into several sections. A microphone array with five DPA 4011c cardioid microphones (microphones 1 to 5) is positioned on a stand in front of the organ’s façade.
</p>

<img class="img-responsive borderless" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/re_1.jpg">
<p class="legend">Figure: Microphone placement during the recording.</p>

<p>
The visible pipes on the organ’s façade are called façade pipes; they adorn the instrument’s front. This microphone array is placed to avoid pointing directly at the pipe mouths. (A microphone aimed at a pipe mouth would amplify its sound and add parasitic noise caused by the air jet exiting the mouth.) This array, processed in post-production with the auralization engine, allows for a realistic rendering of the instrument’s apparent width and its sound radiation. This setup also helps render the different depth planes of the pipes within the organ case’s compartments (close and distant planes).
</p>

<img class="img-responsive borderless" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/re_2.jpg">
<p class="legend">Figure: Microphone placement during the recording.</p>

<p>
The pedal towers on the right and left sides of the grand organ are equipped with two internal microphones each: a Schoeps CMC 1 L – Mk21 wide cardioid and a Schoeps CMC 1 L – Mk4 cardioid (microphones 6, 7, 11, and 12). These are oriented toward the center of the case for even coverage. The central case has a pair of wide cardioid Schoeps CMC 1 L – Mk21 microphones (microphones 8 and 9) positioned inside, behind the façade pipes, aimed at the center of the case. For comprehensive coverage of this section, an additional Mk21 microphone (microphone 10) is placed at the back. Two more Mk21 microphones (microphones 14 and 15) are positioned laterally at the case entrance. An omnidirectional Schoeps CMC 1 L – Mk2 microphone highlights the upper section of the case where the swell organ is located.

<h3>09: Hymne à la liberté, Jean-Baptiste Gossec</h3>

<p>
Recording carried out on April 25, 2024, in the anechoic chamber of Jussieu with Catherine Simonpietri’s vocal class.
</p>

<img class="img-responsive borderless" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/re_15.jpg">

<p>
The singers were equipped with DPA 4088 cardioid headset microphones. The clarinet was captured using a DPA 4099 attached to the instrument and a Neumann KM140 on a stand. The trombone was recorded with a DPA 4099 fixed to the bell and a TLM 170 cardioid microphone on a stand. Lastly, the serpent was captured with a DPA 4099 mounted on the instrument and a KM140 on a stand.

<h3>10: Ouverture de la marche du sacre, Jean-François Lesueur</h3>

<p>
Recording carried out on December 11, 2023, on the Vincent Meyer orchestral stage at the Conservatoire de Paris. Performed by the Orchestre des Lauréats du Conservatoire, under the class of Alain Altinoglu, conducted by Simon Clausse.
</p>

<img class="img-responsive borderless" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/re_10.jpg">

<p>
This piece was recorded on December 11, 2023, on the Vincent Meyer orchestral stage at the Conservatoire de Paris. It is a large 400 m² rehearsal stage for orchestras. To minimize the acoustics of the recording venue as much as possible, each musician was captured using a close microphone placed 30 to 40 centimeters from their instrument. The orchestra consisted of 48 musicians.

<h3>11: Carillon de Westminster, Louis Vierne</h3>

<p>
Recording carried out on October 9, 2023, on the Cavaillé-Coll organ of Saint-Sulpice Church, performed by Olivier Latry.
</p>

<p>
This recording was made at Saint-Sulpice Church, whose 1862 Cavaillé-Coll organ is similar to the one in Notre-Dame during the time Louis Vierne served as its titular organist. The sound of an organ results from various acoustic phenomena. Initially produced by the vibration of multiple pipes, the sound resonates within the organ case before being projected through the façade of the instrument. The Saint-Sulpice organ comprises approximately 7,000 pipes, each constituting a distinct sound source. These pipes, although spatially separated, are grouped within a case divided into several compartments.
</p>

<img class="img-responsive borderless" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/re_8.jpg">

<p>
A two-level microphone array, consisting of DPA 4011c cardioid microphones (microphones 1 to 6 and 7 to 9), is positioned on a stand in close proximity to the organ’s façade, specifically in front of the façade pipes, which are the visible pipes that decorate the organ’s front. These microphones are arranged to avoid directly pointing their capsules at the pipe mouths (as a microphone aimed at a pipe mouth would accentuate its sound and introduce parasitic noise from the air jet exiting the mouth).
</p>

<img class="img-responsive borderless" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/re_6.jpg">

<p>
This array, processed in post-production with the auralization engine, allows for a realistic rendering of the instrument’s apparent width and sound radiation. It also contributes to reproducing the various depth planes of all the pipes across the compartments of the organ case (close and distant planes). The organ case is divided into several compartments, each containing multiple microphones positioned to ensure comprehensive coverage of the instrument. These microphones are used to balance the sound of the instrument in post-production. Microphones No. 10 to 13: Neumann KM140, microphones 14 to 17 and 22 to 23: Schoeps Mk21, microphones 18 to 21 and 26 to 29: Schoeps Mk4, microphones 24 to 25 and 30 to 31: Neumann KM184.
