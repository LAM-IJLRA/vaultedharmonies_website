<h2>Audio rendering tool, bridging research and production</h2>

<p>
Auralization, a method for replicating realistic auditory experiences in virtual settings, is used in architectural acoustics and sound system design [1, 2]. This technique involves convolving anechoic sound with RIRs to simulate how sound travels in specific spaces. Dynamic auralizations increase realism by interpolating between RIRs as sources or receivers move [3, 4].

<p>
To bridge the gap between acoustic research and practical application, we developed <a href="http://roomz.dalembert.upmc.fr/">RoomZ</a>, an audio plugin for digital audio workstations. It allows for dynamic auralizations by adjusting source and receiver positions across RIR grids, featuring fast multi-core convolution and custom navigation scenarios with multi-channel outputs (monaural, binaural, ambisonic, etc.). The interface presents a 2D graphical map for panning, dynamically applying weights based on geometric distributions to convolve the input with appropriate RIRs. RoomZ enables the accurate rendering of environments like a medieval Notre-Dame, directly integrating acoustic research into production, thus enhancing virtual and augmented reality applications.
